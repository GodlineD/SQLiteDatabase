# SQLiteDatabase
 This is the android app,that i've create while learning Android Apps Development through GADS2020. 
 This objective is to learning how SQLiteDatabase works in Android.
 The apps allow a user to insert data into database and then retrive data with a click of button.
 But I run into problem, if I try View  data directly by clicking View All button the app crash. 
 If I insert data first and click View All , the app works perfectly.
 Please help me resolve that error, I've tried to check error in Android studio logcat but I didn't manage to resolve it.
 Any help will be appreciated.THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
